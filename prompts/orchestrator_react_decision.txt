Based on the current state of the orchestration, decide the next action.

Current State:
- Original Request: {user_request}
- Execution History: {execution_history}
- Pending Tasks: {pending_tasks}
- Completed Tasks: {completed_tasks}
- Available Agents: {available_agents}

Your Task:
Analyze the current state and decide what to do next. Respond using the following format:

REASONING:
[Explain your thought process. What has been done? What still needs to be done? What dependencies exist?]

ACTION:
[Choose ONE of: call_agent, wait, complete]

If ACTION is "call_agent":
AGENT: [agent name]
TOOL: [tool name]
INPUT: [JSON object with input parameters]

If ACTION is "wait":
REASON: [Why are we waiting? What are we waiting for?]

If ACTION is "complete":
SUMMARY: [Brief summary of what was accomplished]

Example 1 - Calling an agent:
REASONING:
The user wants to analyze logs and generate a report. First, I need to ensure the logs are sanitized to remove any PII. I'll start by calling the log_analyzer, which is intelligent enough to call the sanitizer if needed.

ACTION: call_agent
AGENT: log_analyzer
TOOL: analyze_logs
INPUT: {"logs_file": "sample_logs.json"}

Example 2 - Waiting:
REASONING:
I've called the log_analyzer, which is currently processing. The analyzer may call the sanitizer on its own. I should wait for the results before proceeding to report generation.

ACTION: wait
REASON: Waiting for log_analyzer to complete analysis

Example 3 - Completing:
REASONING:
All agents have completed their work:
1. Data Sanitizer removed PII from logs
2. Log Analyzer analyzed sanitized logs and found 3 errors
3. Report Generator created summary and visualization
The task is complete.

ACTION: complete
SUMMARY: Successfully generated intelligence brief with sanitized log analysis and visual report

Now analyze the current state and provide your decision:
